# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<h1>Introducton about React </h1>

### why do front-end frameworks exist.

<ul>
<li>The reason is because keeping a user interface in  SYNC with data is Really hard and a lot of work. foont-end framework solve this problem and take hard work away from developers.
</li>
<li>They enforce a "correct" way of structuring and writing code (therefore contributing to solving the problem of *spaghetti*)</li>
<li>They give developers and teams consistent way of building front-end application</li>
</ul>

### What is React

React is a javascript library for building user interface. React is extremely popular declarative component-based, state-driven javascript library for buildinguser interface, creating by facebook ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜šðŸ¤£

### Based on components

React is al about component such as button, input fill, search bar e.t.c. so we build compex UIs in React By building and combining multiple components.

### Component are the building blocks of user interface in React. so how does it work

âœ” Describe what each component look like and how work using a declarative syntax called jsx.
âœ” Declarative mean it tell React what a component shound look like based on current data/state.
âœ” React is abstraction aways from DOM: we never touch the DOM.
âœ” JSX: a syntax that combines HTML, CSS. JavaScript, as well as referencing other React componenets.

### JavaScript Library

Is React Library or a framework but the thing is that a react is just a Library even do i still call it a framework

### When was React Created

React was Created 2011 by Facebook by jordan Walke, an engineer working at the time that is why react is backed by facebook.
React was open-sourced in 2013, and has since then completely transfromed front-end web development.

### Summary

Rendering components on a webpage (UI) based on their current state.
Keeping the UI in sync with state,by re-rendering (reacing) when state changes.

Then seting the my react app.
ESlint
Color Hightlight
Image Preiew
Live Server
Material Icon
One Monokal Theme
Prettier
Open your VS code terminer and create your app.

#### The two option for setting up a react project

1 React which is Create-react-app
2 Vite

âœ” Complete "start kit" for React applicaions
âœ” Everything is already configured: ESlint, Pretter, Jest, e.t.c
